### Your weapon

The three weapons you can choose from (Sword and board, Daggers, and Pike) will each give you a bit more beyond a simple bump attack.

The Sword and Shield will let you block attacks in a straight up fight. More specifically when you do a normal bump attack you gain a 50% of dodging attacks until you move.

The Daggers will give an increasing dodge chance up to 25%. Along with that when you run by enemies, you will get an attack in on othem.

The Pike makes you attack not only the tile in front of you but the one beyond it as well.
